## Future Work
To build on the findings of this study, future work can focus on more advanced temporal modeling techniques to better understand the lead-lag relationship between Twitter sentiment and Bitcoin price fluctuations. Implementing multi-label sentiment classification that captures emotional tones such as fear, greed, or excitement could yield more nuanced insights into market psychology. Additionally, fine-tuning transformer models on finance-specific corpora could enhance the system's contextual accuracy for cryptocurrency discourse. Finally, developing a real-time, interactive dashboard that continuously analyzes live tweets and overlays them with Bitcoin price trends would provide practical value for traders and analysts seeking timely sentiment insights.
